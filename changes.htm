			<li><b>xDirectory only search:</b> This function will require you to change the value in the hidden field: 
			input type='hidden' name='mids[]' value='12' / <br>the current value is 12 you will need to change it to reflect the 
			correct number for your installation of xDirectory. You can find it by going to the "advanced search" page and viewing the code. Look for the "xDirectory"(or whatever you've named it) module checkbox and it will have the value you need.</li>
			</ul>
			
		</p>
		<h2>To Do List</h2>
		<p>
			To allow this module to grow to its full potential,
			a few features are still needed. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The code contains some "// 2Do: " sections;
				they should be looked at and properly dealt
				with (eg: complete/answer/fix/remove it).
			</li>
			<li>
				Separating the language and culture dependant
				aspects from the code. For example: the address
				format differs greatly in countries. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Better CSS compliance (always use the users theme).
			</li>
			<li>
				Faster and better looking (structured and
				formatted) code - with sufficient in-line
				documentation (using PHPDocumentor style comments).
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Change double quotes for single quotes (where appropriate).</li>
				<li>Rewrite the code so the directory name from the module does not have to be xdirectory (but can be renamed by the user).</li>
				<li>Add a noframe tag where a frameset is used.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>
				Completing the help.html files in more languages.
			</li>
			<li>
				Give the "submitter" the ability to modify their
				own listing without admin intervention.
			</li>

			<li>
				Translation: more languages. You can send your
				suggestions to Adam Frick or Pallieter Koopmans.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Future Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				An e-commerce solution where users can submit
				their listings and pay for any upgrades to their
				basic listing online through an e-commerce
				portal. And have it all done automatically
				(without the involvement of the administrator).
				This is a nice feature to add once the entire
				module is bug free and the features above have
				been implemented.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make sponsored section disappear if there are no sponsors. Or add text "Sponsor your Category click here" when there are no sponsors.
			</li>
		</ul>
