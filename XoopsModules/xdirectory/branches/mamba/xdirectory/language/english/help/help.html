        xDirectory is a yellow pages/business directory module based on the webLinks core module. It features multiple categories and sub-categories, address, city, state, zip, and phone listings. It includes a place for website but only activated if a website address is in the DB. This is a Beta version and should only be used for testing right now. The final release will include category sponsorship which will enable you to give a listing a high-profile spot at the top of their category.
